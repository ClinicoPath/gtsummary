## gtsummary

The goal of {gtsummary} is to make reporting of tabular analytic results
simple, beautiful, and reproducible. The packageâ€™s focus is on quickly
summarizing a data set, and formatting the results of regression models
(with help from the {broom} package).

## Installation

You can install the production version of {gtsummary} with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/gtsummary")
```

and the development version with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/gtsummary", ref = "dev")
```

## Examples

The vignettes/tutorials for the primary {gtsummary} functions have
detailed examples and can be found at
[danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary).

### Summary Table

``` r
library(gtsummary)
#> Loading required package: gt
t1 <-
  tbl_summary(
    data = trial[c("trt", "age", "grade", "response")],
    by = "trt"
  ) %>%
  add_comparison() 
```

### Regression Models

``` r
mod1 <- 
  glm(response ~ trt + age + grade, trial, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
t2 <-
  tbl_regression(mod1,
                 exponentiate = TRUE)
```
