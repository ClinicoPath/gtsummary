## gtsummary

A collection of functions commonly used in the work of the biostatisticians. The goal of gtsummary is to make reporting of tabular analytic results simple, beautiful, and reproducible.

## Installation

You can install the production version of gtsummary with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/gtsummary")
```

and the development version with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/gtsummary", ref = "dev")
```

## Examples

The vignettes/tutorials for the primary gtsummary functions have detailed examples and can be found at [danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary).  Each vignette is an Rmarkdown file (*.Rmd) and a copy of the files can be found here: [https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary/tree/master/vignettes](https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary/tree/master/vignettes).  

### Summary Table

```{r t1, include = TRUE}
library(gtsummary)
t1 <-
  trial %>%
  dplyr::select(trt, age, grade, response) %>%
  tbl_summary(by = "trt") %>% 
  add_comparison() 
```

![](man/figures/README-tbl_summary.png){ width=60% }

### Regression Models

```{r regress, include = TRUE}
mod1 <- 
  glm(response ~ trt + age + grade, trial, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
t2 <-
  tbl_regression(mod1,
                 exponentiate = TRUE)
```
